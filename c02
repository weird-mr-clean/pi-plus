"So it's just that simple? We're boyfriend and girlfriend now?" You ask, still not quite believing that this moment is actually happening, and that it was practically dropped into your lap.
Val gazes back at you and gives your hand a little squeeze. "If you want to call it that. I'd certainly like to, but if you want to take it slow..."
You flip your hand over and wrap your fingers around Val's firm palm. "I'm ok with keeping things brisk. Anon and Val, boyfriend and girlfriend..."
Val seems to glow with happiness, and she enwraps your hand as well. Next, she gently tugs on your wrist, beckoning you closer and leaning forward across the table. It's a very easy hint to take.
Reaching across the table with your free hand, you gently touch Val's cheek and run a finger along the bone under her eye. Her skin is soft and smooth, and seems to be actively warming in the wake of your touch. Val closes her eyes and gently leans into your caressing finger. Escalating, you slide your finger down past her mouth and under her chin, ever-so-slightly hooking beneath her jaw. Val keeps her eyes closed, but lets a smile curl her lips before parting them expectantly.
Shifting in your seat, you lean forward, then hesitate for the merest moment, still not quite believing the day's turn. And before you can think any further, you purse your lips and join them with Val's. From the first instant of contact you're practically floating, your world shrinking to this singular point. Val's lips are soft and slightly sticky, still sweetened by the chocolate brownies. She moans into your mouth as you gently nibble and suck, still afraid of overplaying your hand and somehow ruining the moment. In the next beat, you sense more than feel a certain tension uncoiling within Val's being as one of her hands wraps around the back of your head and firmly knots into your hair. You barely have time to gasp at her thrilling and aggressive move before she's pressed voraciously against you, sucking hungrily at your lips and her slick sweet tongue periodically invading your mouth.
When you finally re-open your eyes, you're staring into the face of a radiant goddess. Val's skin is flushed and practically luminescent, her backlit hair glowing angelically, and her eyes burning into you like sapphire flames. 
"Hey."
Val's whisper seems to land on your ears without her mouth moving. Her hand on the back of your head has long since relaxed its grip on your hair, and is presently delivering gentle fingernail-forward scratches to your scalp. In spite of yourself, your eyes roll back for a moment at the delightfully tingly sensation.
"Well, you got me," you laugh softly. "Was it as easy as you expected?"
"Easier," she whispers with an audible smile.
You reach back and wrap your fingers around her wrist, taking in every tactile detail of her smooth skin and contrasting against the wiry sinews beneath.
Val explains, "I know this all seems really sudden, and maybe it is. But I figure - why mess around? Why not just go for it?" Her nails are still sending tingly waves through your scalp and right into your brain.
"Gotta admit," you sigh. "It feels kind of nice to be the pursued one for a change."
Val giggles slowly, then purrs, "Wanna head to the couch?"
"I think that sounds lovely."
Val gestures at a doorway and into a dimly-lit area beyond. "The sitting area is through there - you can't miss it. I'll be there in a sec, I want to do something here real quick."
With an "ok", Val has released her gentle hold and you're on your feet heading through the doorway. Sure enough, you get an unobstructed look at the sitting area. It's actually a little sparse: a TV atop a glass-and-metal stand, a small gaming console on a lower shelf, a coffee table in a similar modern style, an admittedly nice-looking cloth couch, and a wooden end table (maybe a family bequeathment or thrifted). As you sit and attempt to get comfy, you also notice a lightweight computer desk next to a flight of stairs off to the side.
You've barely had time to situate yourself on the spacious couch when Val emerges from the kitchen doorway, holding a spoon and a carton of ice cream (Ken and Barry's, judging by the distinctive color scheme). Upon approaching the couch, she laughs - you must've made a face.
"I'm not done with my dessert!" She chortles.
"Should I even bother asking how you're still hungry?" You laugh back.
"Oh I'm not! But the meal's not done until I'm about to burst!"
She doesn't wait for a response, flopping down next to you on the couch and peeling off the carton's lid. The ice craem looks like some sort of chunky caramel swirl. Val takes a moment to hide a small fresh burp behind her hand, then licks the underside of the lid clean. After setting the lid aside, her hand goes to her midriff, sliding under her loose t-shirt and gently rubbing her gut. Val lets out a sigh and a soft groan, then turns to you and asks, "Would you mind if I undid my button? I love these pants, but the waistband is a little too tight right now..."
There's such a rush of blood to your cock that you can only pray that Val doesn't literally hear it. "Uh, yeah, do whatever you need to."
Val's free hand slides downwards and opens the button on her capris in what you assume to be a deft, fluid motion - you still can't see what's going on under that shirt. She sighs again, this time deeper and with obvious relief. She then extricates her hand and fishes out the TV remote from somwhere to her side, powering on the screen. "Any preferences for a show?" She asks.
"I'm good with whatever. And besides," you muster all the confidence and charm you can manage, "Somehow I don't think we'll be watching the screen that closely."
Val has to swallow a bite of caramel swirl before replying. "Ooh, such confidence. Well, casanova, I'm going to put on a nature documentary, and we'll see where things go from there."
"It's your house," you grin.
With that, Val puts on a nature documentary - it seems to be a collection of vignettes concerning a bunch of predators and currently focused on a pride of lions. Val's definitely rooting for the hunters.
