"So it's just that simple? We're boyfriend and girlfriend now?" You ask, still not quite believing that this moment is actually happening, and that it was practically dropped into your lap.
Val gazes back at you and gives your hand a little squeeze. "If you want to call it that. I'd certainly like to, but if you want to take it slow..."
You flip your hand over and wrap your fingers around Val's firm palm. "I'm ok with keeping things brisk. Anon and Val, boyfriend and girlfriend..."
Val seems to glow with happiness, and she enwraps your hand as well. Next, she gently tugs on your wrist, beckoning you closer and leaning forward across the table. It's a very easy hint to take.
Reaching across the table with your free hand, you gently touch Val's cheek and run a finger along the bone under her eye. Her skin is soft and smooth, and seems to be actively warming in the wake of your touch. Val closes her eyes and gently leans into your caressing finger. Escalating, you slide your finger down past her mouth and under her chin, ever-so-slightly hooking beneath her jaw. Val keeps her eyes closed, but lets a smile curl her lips before parting them expectantly.
Shifting in your seat, you lean forward, then hesitate for the merest moment, still not quite believing the day's turn. And before you can think any furhter, you purse your lips and join them with Val's. From the first instant of contact you're practically floating, your world shrinking to this singular point. Val's lips are soft and slightly sticky, still sweetened by the chocolate brownies. She moans into your mouth as you gently nibble and suck, still afraid of overplaying your hand and somehow ruining the moment. In the next moment, you sense more than feel a certain tension uncoiling within Val's being as one of her hands wraps around the back of your head and firmly knots into your hair. You barely have time to gasp at her thrilling and aggressive move before she's pressed voraciously against you, sucking hungrily at your lips and her slick sweet tongue periodically invading your mouth.
When you finally re-open your eyes, you're staring into the face of a radiant goddess. Val's skin is flushed and practically luminescent, her backlit hair glowing angelically, and her eyes burning into you like sapphire flames. 
"Hey."
Val's whisper seems to land on your ears without her mouth moving. Her hand on the back of your head has long since relaxed its grip on your hair, and is presently delivering gentle fingernail-forward scratches to your scalp. In spite of yourself, your eyes roll back for a moment at the delightfully tingly sensation.
"Well, you got me," you laugh softly. "Was it as easy as you expected?"
"Easier," she whispers with an audible smile.
You reach back and wrap your fingers around her wrist, taking in every tactile detail of her smooth fair skin and contrasting against the wiry sinews beneath.
"I know this all seems really sudden, and maybe it is. But I figure - why mess around? Why not just go for it?" Val explains, still sending tingly waves through your scalp and right into your brain.
"Gotta admit," you sigh. "It feels kind of nice to be the pursued one for a change."
Val giggles slowly, then purrs, "Wanna head to the couch?"
