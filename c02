"So it's just that simple? We're boyfriend and girlfriend now?" You ask, still not quite believing that this moment is actually happening, and that it was practically dropped into your lap.
Val gazes back at you and gives your hand a little squeeze. "If you want to call it that. I'd certainly like to, but if you want to take it slow..."
You flip your hand over and wrap your fingers around Val's firm palm. "Nah. I'm ok with keeping things brisk. Anon and Val, boyfriend and girlfriend..."
Val seems to glow with happiness, and she enwraps your hand as well. Next, she gently tugs on your wrist, beckoning you closer and leaning forward across the table. It's a very easy hint to take.
Reaching across the table with your free hand, you gently touch Val's cheek and run a finger along the bone under her eye. Her skin is soft and smooth, and seems to be actively warming in the wake of your touch. Val closes her eyes and gently leans into your caressing finger. Escalating, you slide your finger down past her mouth and under her chin, ever-so-slightly hooking beneath her jaw. Val keeps her eyes closed, but lets a smile curl her lips before parting them expectantly.
Shifting in your seat, you lean forward, then hesitate for the merest moment, still not quite believing the day's turn. And before you can think any further, you purse your lips and join them with Val's. From the first instant of contact you're floating, your world shrinking to this singular point. Val's lips are soft and slightly sticky, still sweetened by the chocolate brownies. She moans into your mouth as you gently nibble and suck, still afraid of overplaying your hand and somehow ruining the moment. In the next beat, you sense more than feel a certain tension uncoiling within Val's being as one of her hands wraps around the back of your head and firmly knots into your hair. You barely have time to gasp at her thrilling and aggressive move before she's pressed voraciously against you, sucking hungrily at your lips and her slick sweet tongue periodically invading your mouth.
When you finally re-open your eyes, you're staring into the face of a radiant goddess. Val's skin is flushed and all but luminescent, her backlit hair glowing angelically, and her eyes are burning into you like sapphire flames. 
"Hey."
Val's whisper seems to land on your ears without her mouth moving. Her hand on the back of your head has long since relaxed its grip on your hair, and is presently delivering gentle fingernail-forward scratches to your scalp. In spite of yourself, your eyes roll back for a moment at the delightfully tingly sensation.
"Well, you got me," you laugh softly. "Was it as easy as you expected?"
"Easier," she whispers with an audible smile.
You reach back and wrap your fingers around her wrist, taking in every tactile detail of her smooth skin and contrasting against the wiry sinews beneath.
Val explains, "I know this all seems really sudden, and maybe it is. But I figure - why mess around? Why not just go for it?" Her nails are still sending tingly waves through your scalp and right into your brain.
"Gotta admit," you sigh. "It feels kind of nice to be the pursued one for a change."
Val giggles slowly, then purrs, "Wanna head to the couch?"
"I think that sounds lovely."
Val gestures at a doorway and into a dimly-lit area beyond. "The sitting area is through there - you can't miss it. I'll be there in a sec, I want to do something here real quick."
With an "ok", Val has released her gentle hold and you're on your feet heading through the doorway. Sure enough, you get an unobstructed look at the sitting area. It's actually a little sparse: a TV atop a glass-and-metal stand plus a small gaming console on a lower shelf, a coffee table in a similar modern style, an admittedly nice-looking grey cloth couch, and a wooden end table (maybe a family bequeathment or thrifted). As you sit and attempt to get comfy, you also notice a lightweight computer desk next to a flight of stairs off to the side.
You've barely had time to situate yourself on the spacious couch when Val emerges from the kitchen doorway, holding a spoon and a carton of ice cream (Ken and Barry's, judging by the distinctive color scheme). Upon approaching the couch, she laughs - you must've made a face.
"I'm not done with my dessert!" She chortles.
"Should I even bother asking how you're still hungry?" You laugh back.
"Oh I'm not! But the meal's not done until I'm ready to burst!"
She doesn't wait for a response, flopping down next to you on the couch and peeling off the carton's lid. The ice cream looks like some sort of chunky caramel swirl. Val takes a moment to hide a small fresh burp behind her hand, then licks the underside of the lid clean. After setting the lid aside, her hand goes to her midriff, sliding under her loose t-shirt and gently rubbing her gut. Val lets out a sigh and a soft groan, then turns to you and asks, "Would you mind if I undid my button? I love these pants, but the waistband is -hrk- a little too tight right now..."
There's such a rush of blood to your cock that you can only pray that Val doesn't literally hear it. "Uh, yeah, do whatever you need to."
Val's free hand slides downwards and opens the button on her capris in what you assume to be a deft, fluid motion - you still can't see what's going on under that accursed shirt. She sighs again, this time deeper and with obvious relief. She then extricates her hand and fishes out the TV remote from somwhere to her side, powering on the screen. "Any preferences for a show?" She asks.
"I'm good with whatever. And besides," you muster all the confidence and charm you can manage, "Somehow I don't think we'll be watching the screen that closely."
Val has to swallow a bite of caramel swirl before replying. "Ooh, such confidence. Well, casanova, I'm going to put on a nature documentary, and we'll see where things go from there."
"It's your house," you grin.
With that, Val puts on a nature documentary - it seems to be a collection of vignettes following different predators and currently focused on a pride of lions. Val's definitely rooting for the hunters, cheering around a mouthful of caramel cream as a group of lionesses drag down an unlucky antelope. In spite of the tangible sexual tension, you get caught up in the moment too, attentively watching the savagery.
As the lionesses finish off their doomed prey, your attempt to recalculate the "right" next move is interrupted by Val thinking aloud. "I've always kinda wanted a cat," she says.
"Yeah?" you reply, feeling a little lame.
Val hurriedly gulps down another bite of her second dessert before replying, "Yeah. I like their independent temprament, but I also like that I can spoil the crap out of them if they warm up to me."
In answer to your curious expression, she continues, "This complex has a no-pets policy. Shame, really. I really like this place, but it's just a little too quiet with just me."
You're about to try a slick quip of "I could fix that", but Val still barges on, "Ah well, I'll deal with that later. If ever. Never planned too far ahead, and things have worked out ok so far."
Thrown off-balance by Val's pre-emptive interruption and her unexpected motor-mouth overall, you don't have a follow-up comment ready. She throws you even further off by holding a loaded spoonful of her ice cream in front of your face. "This is real good, you should have some," she tempts.
Chuckling internally, you just open your mouth, knowing that you probably wouldn't get a word in anyways. Val gently guides the spoon past your lips then flips and drags the bowl against your tongue. Yep, the ice cream is pretty darn good - high on sweetness without somehow being cloying, the caramel shot through with a complementary note of salt which melds seamlessly with peanut fragments and some chocolate chunks. "Yeah, that is real good," you agree, then a moment later realize you had closed your eyes while savoring the treat. 
Eyelids re-opened, you see Val's got the spoon in front of you again, but this time she's holding it backwards, offering you the handle. The implication is pretty clear.
She fixes you with an almost-bashful expression and says, "I know this is sudden, and you don't have to if you don't want to. But -" Val inhales, her taut body seeming to coil with anticipation, "- would you like to try feeding me the rest?"
Despite your earlier half-assed protest, Val's request singes your ears and sends a thrilling pulse through your core and rippling even lower. Presented so bluntly with the opportunity to intimately hand-feed a girl, you quickly realize you were lying to yourself. You want this. You've always wanted this. Everything about Val's bearing is pleading for you to do this; her wide eyes, her nibbled lip, the open zipper on her capris.
"Alright" comes out of your mouth, smoother than you'd expected. You take the spoon and the half-empty tub of ice cream and scoot closer to Val. She settles back against the couch cushions and finally lifts up her shirt, groaning sensually as she caresses her taut, rounded gut. You simply have to stare for a long moment as Val soothes her ache. For all the world she looks pregnant, only hints of her ab muscles stretched atop the distended bulge of her stomach.
"I ate sooo muuuch," she whines huskily, turning her head towards you, tongue restless on her teeth.
Fuck it. Let's get kinky for real.
Meeting her hungering gaze, you grin back and whisper, "But you're not done yet, though, are you?"
"No," Val breathes. "Please... Please help me eat just a little bit more..."
"You keep stuffing yourself like this, you're gonna get fat," you chance some teasing, waggling the spoon half-scoldingly.
Val squirms and sucks a breath through her teeth, a fresh tinge of pink appearing on her cheeks. "You promise?"
With all your heart (and all your loins) you burn to say "yes". Val's self-assured hedonism is plainly obvious, but - that quirk. That damn metabolic quirk. How could you possibly overcome that anomaly when she's been trying and failing for months?
"As much as I can," you answer, the ice cream steadily chilling your fingers. "I can promise I'll help you figure out that metabolsim thing. But that's a problem for later, and you want this ice cream right now, don't you?"
Maybe not the most romantic, but Val seems satisfied with that. She grins, "Why are we still chatting? You said you'd feed me!"
"Alright, open up then," You shoot back, digging into the softened ice cream and scooping out a heaping glob. The vibe re-established, Val closes her eyes, rests her head on the back cushion, and holds her mouth open lasciviously.
Your cock is ready to tear through your pants, but you're not about to back down from the most obvious invitation you've ever seen. You heft out the oversized spoonful and bring it to Val's waiting mouth, depositing the cold lump a touch more clumsily than you intended. Val chuckles cautiously as she takes in the mouthful of ice cream, eyes still closed, and hums with pleasure as she swallows it down. She licks ineffectually at her lips, missing smears of sweet cream.
Reaching with a finger, you try to brush away some of the mess, but Val gently says, "Don't worry about it. Just leave it. I don't mind being a bit of a piggy sometimes."
Another spoonful on the way, and as you bring it to Val, "So you don't mind if-" only part of this spoonful makes it past her lips. A sticky caramel-rich glob pointedly winds up on her chin, slowly melting into a vicsous rivulet and drawing out a slow purring chuckle.
Val's tongue briefly stabs at the glob, repeatedly coming up short, then retreats behind her pearly teeth for good. Eyes still closed she whispers, "If you're going to be wasting food, you better help clean up."
Hovering the carton over Val's chest, you quip, "So if I badly missed your mouth...?"
Val peeks at your antics and grins, but a touch harder. "Not on a first date. But I like the way you think..." She groans then takes a manifestly uncomfortable deep breath. "Please tell me there isn't much left."
A quick glance into the carton. "About a quarter?"
Val immediately groans. A moment later, her hands gently squeeze circles into her bloated tummy and she lets out a tight, uncomfortable-sounding burp. "I can finish this," she hisses. "Especially with your help. Keep it coming, Anon!"
"As you wish, Princess," actually earns you a smile. Another spoonful and Val seems to be slipping back into a haze. She's clearly euphoric despite barely being able to move, her groans and hums growing steadily lustier with each bite. It isn't long before you pull together the last bits of solid-ish sweet mass and deliver them to your new girlfriend.
"Alright, Val," you declare. "This last bit's gonna be an improvised milkshake. You ready?"
In reply, a groan which swiftly morphs into an excited moan. "Please..."
It actually isn't much left, maybe a mouthful, but Val's really packed it away and is feeling every ounce of her feast. You bring up the carton, briefly teasing her lips with the rim before tilting it up and draining the last splashes of the ice cream into her greedy mouth. Feeling a dash of pervy inspiration once you'd drained the carton, you pull it away and pointedly dribble the last bits onto Val's chin, neck, chest, and even manage to get a couple sweet drops onto her bulging middle. Val offers no resistance aside from minimal squirms and giggles as each drop lands.
"Looks like I made a little mess," you chuckle with fake innocence.
"Then you... know... what to do..." Val replies with a touch of difficulty.
You set aside the empty carton and spoon, and lean in towards Val's helplessly overstuffed form. Starting around her mouth, every spot of spilled or "spilled" ice cream recieves a long kiss and a gentle cleanup from your tongue. Val sighs indulgently as you work your way down, her skin warm, soft, and sweet even before considering the errant cream. When you finally reach Val's gravid belly and kiss it clean, she reaches down and gently holds your head in place. Her skin taut against your face and her innards churning away busily, Val whispers, "Feels good to know... that you did this to me, doesn't it?"
The throbbing in your cock crushes whatever protest you might have mustered. You deeply enjoyed this evening, no question about it. A kiss on her swollen tummy before replying, "I hardly did anything though. You did the lion's share of the eating tonight."
Val's fingers again do that delightful scritching thing on your scalp. "Maybe. But you did the last bit... Got me full to the brim... And that's what counts..."
You can only muster a gentle chuckle and smile against her tight skin. "You're weird."
"Takes one to know one." A few long moments of scalp scratches on one sdie of your head, and a warm full tummy against the other. "Still want to be weird with me?" Val asks with a small chuckle.
"Fuck yeah I do," you reply in a heartbeat, and gently pat your ersatz pillow.
Val giggles slowly and teases, "Feeder."
Right on cue you retort, "Piggy."
The two of you share a quiet laugh, then Val looses a groan of genuine discomfort. "I need to shift a bit. And that can't be comfy for you either."
"No," you admit, and haul yourself to a sitting position while Val adjusts her posture as well. 
Even after re-adjusting Val seems ready to fall asleep, hands working on her tummy seemingly on their own. The sun has long since disappeared by now and the room is bathed in blue: the nature documentary has since progressed to a segment on sharks. You distractedly watch the scenes of reef life and death for a few minutes, but can't refrain from commenting on the night.
"Hell of a first date," you unwisely smarm, glancing over at Val.
Instead of some annoyance or retaliatory snark, Val languidly reaches across the couch and clumsily grabs at your hand. "Yeah, it was."
Matching the tight grip on your hand, you can't help but offer some vulnerability. "I still can't believe it was that easy. Hell, you reached out to *me*!" That gets you an encouraging sqeeze, but you continue, "I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. The reveal that this is some elaborate prank..."
Val's eyes glitter in the dim light. "Anon..."
"Val, I'm terrible with girls," falls out of your mouth. "There's no way I'm living up to whatever you imagined me as back as a teenager."
A sad smile, and those sparkly eyes go wide. "No," Val whispers. "You're better."
You try to say something, but Val gently shushes you, effortfully reaching over with her other hand. "I'm... impulsive. Clearly." She says uncertainly. "Everything in me was screaming to take it easy tonight, yet here we are." She pats her bulging stomach for emphasis, and despite the angst the two of you chuckle. "Anon, do you think we're moving too fast?"
The blunt question catches you a little off-guard. A moment for genuine consideration, and you answer, "Ok, maybe a little? We didn't do much talking tonight, heh." Val's face falls a bit, and you scramble to add, "But we'll have plenty of time for talking in the future!"
"Future, huh?" Val grins warmly. "So how much cooldown time will you need before our next date?"
"Ask me in the morning? Let's just enjoy tonight?"
"Sure." Another hand-squeeze and other grin. God, Val is pretty but that's not why your heart is melting. Maybe it is the romance of the long-unrequited crushes getting together. Maybe it's because she's clearly kinky as hell? Maybe it's all of the above and a certain something more. You already know you'll be seeing her again ASAP, and Val knows it too. Niether of you needs to say it, though.
