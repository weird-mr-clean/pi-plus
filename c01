It is the start of a Tuesday in early May for the town of Northeaston, or "Anytown" for the hip: concrete suburbia struggling to conquer rolling hills, crashing into indomitable old-timey charm and piling into a modest but shiny city center. The sun has just peeked above the horizon, casting golden light across the land and into windows, stirring souls much like those you may already know, yet not quite the same. Eyes beign to open, lips take their first conscious breaths, hands flex and grasp for the first time in hours - a perfectly average morning. Except: eyes more readily take in the sight of an abundant human form, lips more easily curl into smiles at the prospect of a big meal, and hands are more accustomed to the feel of soft curves or warm rolls beneath them. This is a world whose inhabitants, quite simply, are down with the thickness.
Which brings us to you.
You are a twenty-something white-collar man, for our purposes we shall call you Anon. The warm golden tide of sunlight reaches your bedroom window and washes over you. You grumble something and turn your back on Sol's warmth, trying to miser a few more moments of sleep before beginning your own day.
A horrendous cacophany explodes from your nightstand. Not the prosaic clanging of your smartphone's alarm clock, a genuine electronic pandemonium, like an armful of dial-up modems screaming in terror before being devoured by an industrial shredder. Yanked immediately and thoroughly awake, heart pounding, you nearly fall out of bed scrambling over to determine exactly what the hell is going on with your device. Your phone screen is a roiling malebolge of alphaneumeric characters, jpeg fragments and scintillating rogue pixels, and just as you're wondering if the formerly-trusty device is about to explode, a calm eye of sorts emerges amidst the digital storm. 
Transfixed, you see some characters appear, clear as day, spelling out "Are you ready for this?"
All you can do is blink. As you behold but fail to process the spectacle, the first message disappears, replaced by "Chaos everywhere".
You stupidly gawp at the screen, and just as the gears finally begin to turn and you resolve to throw the cursed device out the window, stillness falls and the screen goes black. Two moments later, the reassuring routine of the boot cycle begins, the anodyne logo of the manufacturer lighting up the screen. Soon after, the boot process completes normally and the device cheerily displays the lock screen, a colorful abstract design.
With your free hand, you rub a temple and hiss to yourself, "what the fuck", hesitantly plugging in your passcode with the other thumb. The smartphone completes its boot cycle as though nothing happened - not a single pixel on your home screen seems to be out of place. You sigh, note the time, and manually disable the day's wakeup alarm, giving up on some extra shuteye and shuffling into your morning routine. 
The spectacular malfunction of your phone is by far the most exciting thing to happen in months, and that realization gets you a touch reflective as you freshen up. Is this going to be your life from here on out? Morning coffee, modestly-challening job, shuteye, then do it all over again for another thirty-plus years? Maybe get a house somewhere in there (if the earning situation keeps up, this'll actually be in the cards in a couple years)? 
Good lord. Your frontal lobe has just finished baking and you're already thinking in terms of years. And there isn't even a lady in the picture, plus-sized or otherwise. After spitting out some toothpaste and rinsing out your mouth, you take a moment to stare down the man in the mirror. You're not exactly displeased: handsome by your own reckoning, though you perpetually wish you could make it to the gym more no matter how many ads or slogans you see extolling "soft boys". What does displease you is a refreshed sliver of white: a gray hair that first appeared front-and-center during a particularly tough round of final exams back in college. A moment with tweezers and the unwelcome memento mori is washed down the drain. With that, you let out a deep sigh, consciously draining some angst from your chest, which makes space to notice a gnawing sensation a bit further down. Perhaps adulting won't seem so dire after some breakfast.
While slouched into a kitchen chair and picking at some toast, your phone buzzes again. After your bizarre wakeup, the sound sends a lightning bolt through you, and you glance over half-expecting the thing to be on fire.
No fire, no malfunctions, but there is a surprise - a text from a number you don't recognize.
"Hey, is this Anon? You might not remember me, but we kinda knew each other back in high school."
Immediately followed up by, "OMG, I'm such an idiot! This is Val Sojka, if the name rings a bell?"
There's enough emojis to slow your parsing of the messages, but some teenage memories come rushing back. Val (short for Valentine, which she hated) was a striking figure in your class to say the least: Blonde, blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and athletic. Well, "athletic" is underselling it: she was a muscular six-foot-three, outweighed most adult men, and improbably was one of the all-time best tight ends on the football team, boy or girl. She's hard to forget. 
Your pulse picks up as you reply, "Yeah, you've got Anon. I remember you! We were in Ms. Rosenthal's history class junior year, and we did that group presentation on the Cold War?"
"OMG yes! I knew I got the right Anon! lol so I know this is random, but can we catch up and chat sometime soon?"
You blink a few times and your heart skips a beat. This has to be for a good reason, right? No sense in looking a gift... muscle babe? in the mouth.
"I'd love to! But I've got to get to work and I'm having a weird morning to boot. I can try and find a minute later to hash out a time?"
"Ok! My schedule is actually pretty open, so just text me when you can!"
With that, you fire back a quick acknowledgement and finish your prepratory routine, but now infused with elated, nervous energy. As you hop into your car and head for work, you realize that you're actually badly out of the loop regarding your old friends. Sure, you're still close with Carlos and the dudes in his orbit, but he's about the only one you'd stayed in contact with. Your social media accounts are basically for show, and your circle was never particularly active online either. 
As you round a corner and approach the drab block of your office, two thoughts strike you. First, if nothing else, (re?)connecting with Val would be a great chance to catch up with your old group by proxy. The second thought draws a smirk - maybe Val ran into the old "football player curse" and put on a little chub in the intervening years.

~~~~~

Morning in the office is a fluorescent blur. Spreadsheets, the same tired jokes about the weather, the same dirtlike breakroom coffee, stealth glances at well-fed office lady butts in plus-sized pants or skirts. 
Around noon you take a much-needed break back to the real world, and trek out from the building, walking towards a food court a few minutes away. There's a few options, but a certain sandwich shop, the local Lotza's franchise, is your favorite. Not for the food, though it is solid.
The line stacked up before the ordering counter is actually a blessing in your book, because it gives you plenty of time to steal glances at a seemingly-omnipresent chubby cashier girl. Her black work jeans are practically sprayed over thick hips and a luscious tummy pooch, and her uniform shirt seems to strain with every motion of her plump middle and arms. A nametag, pinned conspicuously near plunging cleavage, declares the owner of said cleavage to be one Syl. A grin never leaves her round face as she effortlessly weaves small talk in between taking orders, and a short chestnut ponytail bounces around cheerfully as she gestures and works.
Soon enough you're face to face with Syl the cashier. A hand sinks into her denim-clad flank as she politely awaits your order.
"Hi, just a number 3 with an unsweet tea, please."
"Sure thing," she says with a smile. "Anything else?"
"Nah, that's it."
"You sure? You look pretty hungry to me." Now a grin, and a wink.
"Temptation," you laugh. "Just what I need! But no, I'm good."
She punches in your order to the screen while evenly retorting, "It's a lot easier than you'd think. Especially for a regular like you."
You must've replied with a stupid face, because Syl laughs again.
"Always gotta try!" She hands you a receipt. "It'll be ready in a few minutes."
A spin by the self-serve fountain, a double-check that you're indeed selecting the reserve of unsweetened tea, then a few awkward minutes with the other hungry patrons at the pickup area. The staff is working fast, and you've barely settled in to wait before you're scooping up your tray and making your way outside for some fresh air. An unbidden vision of Syl growing fatter in real-time, her strained uniform growing tighter, and tighter, seams starting to give... You mentally swat away the spicy but ill-timed fantasy and find a free table.
The number three is a turkey sandwich, stacked with a quotidian array of lettuce, tomato, and mayo, but with a rather uniquely quality toasted bun. You've barely swallowed the first bite of your meal when a gruff voice erupts to your side.
"She did WHAT? Oh, not again..."
Managing not to jump, you turn towards the voice and take in a sturdy but scruffy blue-collar guy leaning against a nearby table. One hand holds a cell phone to his ear, the other rubs a grey-streaked temple. Judging from the fluorescent hi-vis vest (partially hiding a Dropkick Murphys t-shirt) you guess the guy's working at one of the nearby construction projects.
"Well if little miss Carol actually apologized this time, I'll make sure my daughter does too."
Silence on this end of the line, then, "Right. I appreciate that, I suppose. Yes, I'll be able to pick her up after school today. And yes, I'll talk to her. Again."
With that, the guy hangs up and slams a hand onto the table, cursing not quite under his breath. He glances up and makes eye contact with you. You know better than to play innocent, so you simply play the situation straight. "Sorry, man, wasn't trying to eavesdrop. Everything ok?"
His body language is hard to get a fix on. After a tense moment he says, "Not really. My daughter got into another fight at school today."
The man's stark admission isn't particularly surprising, but it's still jarring. "I'm sorry to hear that. Teenager?"
A "yeah" plus a glance off to the side. The next moment, the man's gaze is back on you.
"Honestly, I'm at fuckin'... wit's end, dude. If you've got any ideas, I - nah, that's stupid. I shouldn't be bothering you with my problems."
Something about his weary body language grabs at you. "It's ok. What kind of advice? Dunno how much help I'd be, but I can give it a shot."
The man visibly slouches a touch more and sighs, "You sure?"
You nod and set your sandwich down. This seems serious.
"My daughter Lisa, she's fifteen and... Ugh, it's so crazy, man. She's turned into a total wild card, I don't know where it came from. She could be a complete hellion one moment, and the next she's apologizin' from the bottom of her heart."
After a long pause, "I just don't know what to do. Part of me's thinkin' about military school. All this is on top of her getting arrested last week!" He quickly clarifies, probably to answer your raised eyebrows, "They let her off with a warning, but still. I'm just worried that she's on a fast track to some real trouble."
Gesturing at a nearby seat, you finally reply, "Geez, that does sound serious. But maybe we can put our heads together."
The man extends his hand, and the two of you shake. His grip is calloused and firm, but respectful - he doesn't try to yank your arm off. "Duane."
"Anon. Nice to meet you."
After Duane sits, a small smile cracks his face. He smells a bit like an ashtray. "To be fair, the arrest was for some bullshit loitering charge. I got into way worse trouble when I was her age, heh. Thank God we didn't have the internet back then."
He chuckles again, and you offer a small laugh in return.
"So," you start cautiously. "I'm not a dad, and I don't know shit about raising any sort of kid, much less a teenage girl. But if you're asking me to talk off the cuff..."
"I think I am."
"It sounds like your daughter might be acting out for attention? It's a real common thing for teenagers, or so I've heard."
Duane gazes past you and watches a few cars roll by on the nearby road. "I'd considered that," he eventaully replies. "Everything's been fucked since the divorce."
Taken aback, you avoid stammering, "I'm sorry?"
"Don't be. There's a reason I got custody. But that's a whole 'nother can of worms."
Another pause, but Duane continues monologuing a bit. Maybe he just needed a sympathetic ear. "I know I haven't been around much. I'm busting my ass to keep a roof over our heads, but I know little Lisa isn't seeing that. She just sees her dad isn't around much."
"That's gotta be real tough. I couldn't imagine, Duane."
"Yeah..."
An awkward pause, then an idea. "The two of you must bond over something, right? Uh, maybe there's a class that she really enjoys?"
Duane's eyes seem to light up a bit. "Lisa gets ok grades, but now that you've mentioned it - we took a trip to the Carbon Spires National Park last year. She took so many pictures with her crummy lil' phone, I saved some cash and got her a proper digital camera that Christmas!"
"Hey, that's something!"
"God, I've been so burnt-out from work, I barely noticed she's been snapping up tons of pictures." Duane scratches his stubbly chin pensively. He hammers a fist onto the chintzy table, drawing a couple nearby sets of eyes. "I'm going to set aside more energy for her. She's my goddamned daughter. She deserves nothing less!"
You grin at your surprise guest. "She's got to know you're busting your ass, and I'm sure that even a quick photo review session would mean a lot to her!"
Duane grins at you and grips your shoulder. Internally you hope he isn't smudging your shirt, but you're more charmed by this moment of human connection. "Maybe she'd be into some photography lessons," he muses. "It'd be a way to keep her out of trouble too.."
The two of you share a quick laugh, then with a metallic scrape, the older man is back on his feet. "Man I picked a winner, huh?" He chuckles. Before he turns to leave, he fishes something out from his vest pocket. It's a business card, a little bent up but otherwise fine. "Hey, Anon, you're alright. Dunno if you'd want to keep in touch with ol' Duane, but if ya do..."
Accepting the card, you reply, "Thanks man. I just hope I gave you good advice!"
He turns a bit more, but another laugh, "Can't hurt! And if worse comes to worse, I'll figure something out. I'm a big boy after all!"
And with that, he's dipped into the sandwich shop, doubtless an easy mark for Syl's upselling charms. You do actually load Duane's contact info into your phone, praying that the device won't eat the data with another digital seizure some day.
The rest of your meal is blessedly lonely. Soon enough, you've tossed your trash and are headed back out of the restaurant, though not before stealing one more glance at Syl. This time she's unwittingly struck a pouty pose, chubby hip checked to the side as she glares at an apparently-misbehaving register.
You only allow yourself a moment, and are promptly pounding concrete on the way back to your office building. Thoughts of your eventful lunch plague you, but Duane's predicament just doesn't stick. Maybe you push him and his daughter aside because you've already done all you reasonably can to help. In spite of your altruistic insticts, of course it's Syl, that reubenesque sandwich goddess, who takes up the most space in your mind.
"You look pretty hungry to me..."
Quit thinking with your dick, man. Yeah, you are in fact hungry, maybe because you've been single for too long. Besides, she probably says that to everybody.

~~~~~

You push past the glass doors of your office buidling, heave your way back up the stairs, and yawn. Though the morning's phone incident was close to your normal wake-up time, you still blame the malfunction for cutting into your energy. Need coffee. Roll past the cubicle farm and into the little breakroom. There's a pot ready, so you load up a paper cup, blow across the rim, and stare into the liquid darkness, thinking. Not about Syl or Duane, or even Val for that matter. The change of location has gotten your head back in the game, and now you're mulling over customs laws for a demanding client who wants a shipment of fancy Indonesian ironwood timber.
The sound of nearby footsteps pulls you back to the moment. You look up from the caffienated abyss and spot your coworker Kelly, emerging from the shared fridge with a flat container and a slightly-concerned expression. Though she's about your age, Kelly has a powerful "team mom" aura, an impression only enhanced by her plump busty figure and disarming squirrely smile. "You doing ok, Anon?" she asks.
You return a wry grin. "I'm having a wierd day, and that ironwood contract makes me want to die."
"Awww," she bursts out simultaneously laughing and cooing. "You having a delayed case of the Mondays?"
"Guess so, heh."
Without another word, Kelly holds out her arms, offering a hug as she frequently does. You let her come in, and return the brief embrace with your free arm. It's comforting to be sure, but you don't dwell on the sensation - Kelly is very much taken and this is a professional environment after all. 
She pulls away, apparently satisfied with the change in your expression or bearing.
"Guess I needed that," you quip.
"That's what they all say! Listen, Anon, boss man gave you that project because he knows you can handle it, and I believe in you too!"
"Thanks, K. I gotta get back to it."
Kelly gives you a polite wave and returns to her lunch container (something with rice), and you start back to your cube. A few moments later, you're settling into your chair and trying to find your center amidst the busy buzz of the office.
One last distraction though. You break out your phone and finally dash off a text to Val. "Hey, this morning's been crazy, but do you still want to hash out a meetup time? Also, can I ask why you've reached out? Did something happen?"
A reply comes surprisingly promptly, "I just wanted to see you and to reminisce. Is that suspicious somehow lol?"
You're trying to read between the lines and failing. Is Val actually hitting on you?
Gather more information. "Gonna be honest, I'm pretty out of the loop too, but last I saw you were pretty steady with Dale."
"Don't worry about him," comes back with a cluster of cheeky emojis.
Your eyes bug out and you need a moment to compose your next message, "I can't help but be worried about Big Dale, Val. If you're asking me to go behind his back, he will literally kill me. Maybe eat me too, like with a fork."
There's a long pause on the other end, then you see the bouncing triple dots indicating an in-progress response. You count off a solid 100 seconds before Val's next message finally lands: "Dale and I have been split up for months, but yeah I guess you wouldn't have a way of knowing that."
In spite of the angst-soaked words, your heart soars, and a smile immediately cracks your face. And there's more.
"Anon, to tell the truth, I had a crush on you back then and I think I still do. Sorry to ruin the surprise lol."
Sheer elation nearly knocks you from your chair, but before you can begin to compose a reply, Val drops another bomb: "To keep telling the truth, senior year I was going to ask you to prom. I made a deal with Dale and everything. But you got to Jen literally one day before. OMG I was so jealous!"
You must've made some sort of weird noise, because your cube neighbor rolls back and gives you a concerned look. He returns to his workstation after you give him a halfhearted "I'm ok" gesture.
A breath to recenter, and you decide to stick with the reminiscing. "Val, that's simply amazing. And I thought that prom already had so much drama around it. Lena and I made a deal too, but I still thought she was going to kill me when she actually saw Jen on my arm."
"OMG right? I remember that! And I remember how happy Jen looked... See, this is why we need to catch up, Anon!"
A glance up to the heavens, and a subvocalized "I don't know why I deserve this, but thank you God".
Looking back at the screen, about all you can muster is a simple, "When and where do you want to meet?"
"Dinnertime, so about six-ish and at my place?" Val attaches her current address and instructions to reach her specific condo unit.
You do a little mental math before sending your reply, "Would you mind if I headed there straight after work? I'll probably be a bit early if I do that."
"Perfectly fine! I'll see you this evening!" The added heart-studded emojis are probably just Val being over-the-top girly. Probably?
The afternoon is intractable. Constant false-starts on finding the appropriate customs forms and regulations are driving you nuts, but you do eventually nail down the applicable statutes in the waning hour of the workday. Having reached a stopping point, and way more excited about what awaits you on the outside, you're promptly hauling ass to your car and down the road. For a moment, until you run into the rush hour. Plus an accident. Plus some roadwork. All told it takes you almost 45 infuriating minutes to reach Val's place, though it probably won't be so bad next time.

~~~~~

Val lives in a rather unorthodox modern-style condo complex with generous covered parking. Double-checking to ensure you're in a visitor or undesignated spot, you shut down the engine and practically skip through the hallway toward Val's unit. Everything is clean and bright in desaturated earth-tones, the condo doors painted in a gradient of calming greys and browns. Val's door is a pale taupe, somehow almost purple-ish. For a moment you consider sending a text to announce your arrival, but decide instead to just go for it. Thrice you smartly rap your knuckles on the door. It feels fairly solid. A moment later the latch clicks and the door swings open.
The first thing you do is tilt your head back slightly, and you're eye-to-eye with Val Sojka for the first time in years. Her eyes are crystal-blue, nestled under prominent cheekbones and framed by a fair heart-shaped face. The fluffy bun topping her head is every bit as blonde as you remember and a touch messy. A calm smile plays on her lips, with an unplaceable energy bubbling beneath the surface. You can feel your pulse thrumming from your chest up into your temples.
"Heyyy! Glad to see you could make it, Anon! C'mon in!"
Val reaches out, perhaps to touch your shoulder, but stops short, instead beckoning you over the threshold. So much for her getting chubby - Val's arm is every bit as wiry and sturdy as you remember, maybe even moreso. In spite of yourself and your own preferences, your gaze sticks to her forearm for a long instant, fascinated by the taut interplay of tendons and muscle as she gestures.
Somehow you're across the threshold and the door latches behind you.
"Anon, are you ok?"
You blink and your mind returns to your own body. Val's front door opens into a rather wide tiled space, a dining table to your right and a kitchen area to the left. Covered cookware and scattered packaging tells you that Val was cooking even before the aroma of sauteed garlic hits your nose.
"Wha? Oh yeah, sorry. Guess I'm a little out of it, today's been crazy," you answer a little sheepishly.
"That's alright," Val laughs. "Sounds like you could use some dinner. Chicken alfredo sound good? Oh, wait - gosh I should have asked first!"
"Relax, I'm not a picky eater, especially if somebody else cooked. I'm sure it'll be great," you say politely.
Val grins and leads you over to the table, and you glance at her figure while she double-checks the table setting. Yep, still just as tall and imposingly-built as you recall. Her outfit is a mix of complement and concealment: knee-length capris that hug her powerful thighs and show off her calves, paired with a loose purple t-shirt draped over doubtlessly shredded abs. A moment later, you sit.
You barely have time to fiddle with the weighty silverware before Val swoops by the table with a steaming pot of pasta and spoons a generous portion into your bowl. She sits across from you and barely fits a double-portion into her own bowl.
"Bon appetit!" She giggles, and digs in without a reply from you.
And with that, you start in too, twisting up a small tangle of fettucine, dripping in creamy sauce. It's good: first thing you notice is the smooth, savory hit of the sauce, counterweighted with a strong but not overpowering note of garlic. Something has you suspecting that she made the sauce from scratch, and the gentle not-quite-crunch of the al dente noodles adds to your enjoyment. Taking another bite, you go for a chunk of chicken. Breast meat, and a good cut, flavored through without drying out at all.
"This is really good, thanks for cooking and for having me over, Val." You don't even have to try to sound appreciative.
Val slurps a stray length of pasta past her lips, licks away a blob of cream, and swallows heavily before replying. "Thanks!" She beams, "I've really gotten into cooking, and I just plain kind of like doing nice things for my friends."
"So we're friends already?" You grin.
"Why wouldn't we be?"
"Got me there."
Another awkward bite or two, and you peek over to see that Val is seriously outpacing you, even counting her larger portion. Somehow you manage to keep a poker face and attempt to restart the conversation. "So... Uh, I managed to spoil one of the reasons you wanted me to come over, but wasn't there another?" You ask, not certain how to address Val's confessed crush.
Val again has to swallow before speaking. "Honestly the crush was the big one," she giggles, and your heart again soars. Contrasting with her imposing physique, Val's voice is on the higher side and very girly. Her giggles immediately set you smiling. "But I have been in touch with who I think was your old ladyfriend cabal?"
Now it's your turn to down a bite of pasta before replying. "You mentioned Lena and Jen. How about Zoe and Vicky?"
"Vicky! I knew it was something with a V," Val snaps her fingers. "Well, lemme start from the beginning. Lena and I ran into each other at the mall a few months back. We wound up next to each other in line for a food stall and got to talking."
Val takes another small bite, "She's doing good. Got a biology degree, works at some sort of lab or a clinic these days? Could never really keep the details straight. We actually do little meal meetups pretty regularly, it's how I met - re-met? - the others."
You let Val continue as she counts off one-by-one on her fingers. "I'm not 100% on what Jen did after high school, but these days she works at her family's cafe. Zoe got some kind of business-related degree down in Novaville, and she does something with quality; still with Matt actually."
In spite of yourself you smirk. Sounds like the two teenage sweethearts are still treating each other right. Val doesn't notice your expression. "Vicky got an engineering degree, I forget where. She's always really busy but she loves her work."
"Geez," you exhale. "Now I feel like an asshole for not staying in touch."
"Hey, this is a way of staying in touch."
"Well how about yourself?" You ask.
Val's demeanor darkens a little bit. She pushes around a clump of pasta for a long moment before answering. "Well, I couldn't get a sports scholarship or an academic scholarship, and... well... the money situation wasn't great for a degree, so I started working pretty quick."
"No sports scholarship?" You blurt out, probably unwisely. "That's ridiculous!"
More pasta nudging before Val's sigh and reply. "I know. But it all worked out."
You feel a little warm under the collar. "Sorry, I didn't mean to-"
Val fixes you with a small smile, "It's alright. Really. It sucks, it's unfair, but that's life. I got started as a personal trainer. Surprisingly lucrative, at least it was for me."
She finally spears a morsel and downs it before continuing, "Saved up some money, did some thinking, and started taking night classes for a finance associate's degree. I'm... doing ok for myself now."
Something tells you that Val is not a good keeper of secrets, but you don't pry. "What matters is that things worked out, right?"
"Yeah, haha. Got a nice place, made some new old friends, and now..." Val's eyes seem to glint in the evening light, "I've got my old teenage crush trapped in my lair." Her smile is toothy but lacks any real menace.
"Val, are you asking me out?" You laugh.
"I think we skipped that step," she retorts. "You are actually single, right?"
"Yeah," you reply a tad hesitantly. "Honestly all of this just... seems too easy? Too good to be true?"
"Sometimes nice things happen for no particular reason. You got lucky, the stars aligned from your perspective. Why overthink it?" Val breezily props her chin against her knuckles.
You need a moment to think about the conversation's turn, ironically enough.
"Speaking of thinking," Val interrupts your nascent internal monologue, "I think I could use some chocolate. You ready for dessert?"
"Sure," you answer, immediately moving to scarf down the last remnants in your bowl. Truthfully the rich pasta was more than satisfying, but you're presently very concerned with ingratiating yourself to Val.
She rises to her feet and strides across the dining area. You make sure to steal a glance at her toned backside as she walks, especially when she bends down and reaches into the fridge. Does she know you're staring?
The next moment you've snapped your gaze innocently forward again, and Val glides back to the table, depositing a neatly-arranged plate of brownies and two fresh glasses of milk. 
"Made 'em today!" Val says brightly before scooping up one of the chocolatey bricks and taking a huge bite. 
Weighed down by all the carbs and butter, your stomach gurgles uncomfortably at the sight. Still, you want to be a good guest, so you tear one of the brownies in half and sink your teeth in. It's admittedly fantastic - the cold temperature is refreshing and adds a nice feel of resistance to the fudgy matrix. The unmistakable smooth complexity of dark cacao sinks deeply into your gums and tongue as you chew - Val must have also sprung for primo ingredients here.
You're nibbling at the half-brownie, easing the treat into your belly, when you spot movement. Val's going for seconds. Or rather, seconds and thirds, alternating bites from fresh brownies in either hand.
Val catches your eye, and you must've made some sort of face, because she shoots you an impish chocolate-flecked smile. "What?" She chortles, "I'm a girl. This is chocolate. Do the math!"
Closing your eyes and putting on what you hope is a sage expression, you reply, "It's rude to comment on others' eating habits."
Val smirks back at you, then pops the last hunk of one brownie into her mouth and says around it, "Well what if I'd like you to comment on what I just ate?"
This throws you, but only for a moment. Was Val always this much of a trip? Evenly you reply, "Well, you're bigger than me and you look like you're still working out. It makes sense you'd have an appetite, though admittedly this isn't exactly performance food."
Val sucks some chocolate from her thumb then extracts the digit with a soft pop. Reaching for a fourth (!?) brownie, she replies, "That's because it obviously isn't!"
"Val, I'm confused. Where are you going with this?"
She gulps down a mouthful of chocolate and looses a quiet moan before bluntly addressing you, "Anon, I've been eating like this for the past three months."
Pieces, threads, bits of evidence, appear in your head and start floating around like some mental conspiracy board, but nothing's quite lining up. You think for a long moment. Even if Val had a ridiculous metabolism - not implausible, it'd match her powerful physique - three months of meals like this would surely stick something to her.
"You're pulling my leg."
"I promise you I'm not. And again," Val's face takes on a curious expression, "I'm directly asking you to comment on that fact." She then pauses her chocolate binge and poses gently, making sure to flex her arms and chest. With a half-eaten brownie in either hand, the net effect is incongruous and amusing.
"You're sure?"
"Yes!" with noticeable annoyance.
"Wow. Well," you start. "Three months of a heavy surplus and no fat gain seems... strange. Though you probably know way more about bodybuilding and macros and stuff than me."
"Anon," Val fixes you with a serious look. "This is also hard to believe, but I never paid attention to that stuff either. I just ate whatever, worked out, and got stronger. I have never done a proper bulk-and-cut cycle."
"Honestly? That sounds like the exact opposite of a problem."
"It's the entire problem!" Val almost yells but pulls herself back. "Anon, I... Haven't told many people this but - I like being strong, but I... I actually really, really want to be curvy."
"You want to get fatter?" Even to you, in this more enlightened place and time, the words feel surreal coming off of your lips.
"Fat? Heh," There's the merest glint of mania in Val's blue eyes. "I want to be huge."
She just laughs at your wordless staring reply.
"And that is the other actual reason I wanted to talk and catch up," Val explains. "I wanted to see if your old feeder magic still worked."
Ah shit, not that stupid rumor again.
"Val..." you groan, tiredly pinching the bridge of your nose. "This would be a lot for any day, and today was so fucking wild already..."
"I'm sorry... Should I drop it?"
"No," you groan again. "Just gimme a second to think."
You probably take over a minute before speaking again. "Ok, one thing at a time. Val, how long have you wanted to get fatter?"
Val dabs her mouth with a napkin. Aside from the specimen you tore in half, the brownies are all gone. She stifles a small burp, then puts on a pensive face and replies, "Honestly, probably for about as long as I can remember. I can't point to any specific experience or memory off the top of my head."
"Interesting. Now, on to this feeder business," Your tone hardens a bit. "I will not deny that I like bigger girls. That said, I did not feed or encourage any of the girls in my orbit to gain weight. Not Lena, not Zoe, not Vicky."
A pause, then with an authoritative upturned index finger, "I'll admit a sorta for Jen, but only because she was clearly underweight and trying to change that for a long time."
Val looks at you with an unreadable expression. Confusion coupled with interest? "Why the rumor then?"
"Damned if I know. Teenagers are awful. Maybe because I picked up the tab for sides or extra helpings once in a while? Maybe because I stuck up for my friends when dipshit jocks tried to bully them?"
Val seems to flinch at the "dipshit jocks" comment, then takes a long moment to digest this revelation. One of her hands is under the table, probably rubbing her belly. In spite of the moment and yourself you can't help but wonder how that washboard stomach looks when filled with huge meal. "So you're not actually a feeder, huh?" The disappointment in her voice is impossible to miss.
You nearly choke on your sip of milk. After recovering, you admit, "I could be? Er, I am? I... suppose I idenfity as one? On paper? Internally. But it's not something I've ever intentionally done. It... just feels like something intimate. Like something you should only do within a couple."
Val grins at you, "So what if we became a couple?" As she speaks, she reaches out and gently grips your hand. Sure enough, she's got some slight weight-lifter calluses, but her touch radiates nothing but tenderness, femininity, and desire.
Never mind your heart skipping a beat, your whole body seems to miss a few entire moments from sheer excitement.
"I'd like that," comes out of your smiling mouth with no conscious action, and your heart soars.
