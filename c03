"So you're calling yourself a dyed-in-the-wool fat admirer and you've never heard of Honey Cruz?"
Val's eyes are wide and she's practically quivering from containing her laugheter. Though the Bent Palm Cafe apparently isn't much for a late lunch crowd, you're a touch worried about how far her snickering outburst might have traveled. Still, you stand your ground.
"Sure, guess I'm a fake FA for not knowing every single plus-sized model on the internet, especially since fat became fashionable!" Hopefully your sarcasm lands as playful rather than biting.
Val narrows her eyes across the rim of her soda, but you see a smile creeping around the edges of the glass. She sets down her drink, pulls out her phone and starts tapping at it. In contrast with her extravagantly girly texting style, her phone case is comparatively subdued, just a sleek candy-tone magenta shell.
"I seriously can't tell if you're fucking with me," Val smirks and furiously pokes and swipes at the device, presumably looking for something. "One, Honey is famously super-sized, not plus-sized. Two, she's probably the most famous fat porn acrtress in the business."
You're mulling some sort of retort when Val abruptly flips her phone around and holds the device towards you. "So you've seriously never seen this big lady before?" Val smirks and points a demanding finger at a figure on the screen. You behold a tall and massively curvaceous woman in a short clingy crimson dress, apparently photographed at an adult film convention going off of the background. Her face is chubby and apple-cheeked with a tawny complexion and a surprisingly subtle second chin, smooth save for some slight smile lines. Even in the tiny photo, her eyes flash a mischevious warm brown - perhaps you were primed by hearing her stage name, but the comparison to honey seems spot-on. Bouncy black hair with a few thin silver streaks falls past squishy shoulders and somehow pulls your eye towards monumental cleavage between head-sized breasts, obviously but pleasingly enhanced by a powerful push-up bra. A thick beige belt is snugged over Honey's pillowy belly, which visibly hangs low enough to cover her sex. She has a pudgy hand propped on one of her doughy, doubtless door-filling hips, showing off a full sleeve of intricate tattoos. You briefly register that her upper arm is probably thicker than your thighs, then move on to regard the model's thighs, largely uncovered by her skimpy dress. They're simply massive, barrel-like, squishing into each other down to her knees and gently rolling with dimply cellulite. Her calves continue tapering smoothly downwards, ending with plump feet strapped into a sturdy pair of wedge heels.
"Wait, wait..." You stall, partly thinking but also partly drinking in Honey's overabundant assets. "Yeah, no, I do recognize this lady. Blanked on the name somehow."
Val withdraws her phone and slides it back into her purse. "No idea how you could," she snickers.
A sip of iced tea, then you retort, "Again, I don't know what to tell you. Guess I just plain never bothered to keep track of every quote, top model out there." At that, a certain awkward silence descends. Val takes a large, barely-polite bite out of her huge ham sandwich, and you gnaw off a piece of your own BLT. A swallow, then, "Actually. I hope I'm not prying, but how come you're so invested in that space? Are you a fashionista, orrr...?"
"Oh, that's easy," Val replies immediately. "I think Honey is one of the most gorgeous women alive, and I hope I wind up with a figure like hers when I finally manage to fatten up."
So much for a "normal" date conversation. Maybe it could be steered back to mundane topics... later. This revelation is worth digging into. Delicately.
